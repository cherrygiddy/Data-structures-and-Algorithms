Compare priorityQueue with Queue in a Queue it has slower insert O(n) and faster delete O(1) While in a Heap
it has faster insert O(log n) and slower delete O(log n);


  public class priorityQueuewithHeap{
      private Heap heap= new Heap;
    1.  public void add(int item){
        heap.insert(value);
      }
    2.  public int remove(){
        return heap.remove;
    }
   3.public boolean isempty(){
     return heap.isempty;
   }

}
